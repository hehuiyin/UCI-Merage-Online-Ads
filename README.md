# UCI-Merage-Online-Ads

## Background

Established in 1965, UCI’s Paul Merage School of Business offers a wide range of
academic degrees from undergraduate, graduate, to doctorate. While the school offers programs for varying tiers of education, this project will focus on the following Master’s programs: Fully Employed MBA (FEMBA) and Full Time MBA (FTMBA). Considering its respectable ranking, Merage can still find ways to improve its online presence and outreach to prospective students.

## Dataset

Our datasets observe social platform performance and lead source information from 2016 to 2020. The social platform dataset overviews the metrics of advertising campaigns from LinkedIn, Google, and Facebook, whereas the lead source dataset records the time of the initial inquiry of prospective students, application status, last time modified, and the source the lead is from.

## Goal

Our objectives for this project are to answer the below two questions:

* Which online advertising mechanism has a higher quality lead?
* How to better allocate spend on each online advertising social platform?
